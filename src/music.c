/*
 * Background music: ZMT tracks (tools/make_music.py) played with ZGDK's tracker.
 *
 * One track is loaded at a time. A pattern_t takes 772 bytes of RAM, so all tracks share three
 * pattern buffers (the start of asset_work, after the tileset has gone through it), and a track is
 * read from tidepup.zar into zmt_buf and parsed by zmt_rom_load() when it changes. ZGDK's device
 * loader is private (zmt_file_load() only takes a path); a public zmt_dev_load(track, dev) would
 * stream it from the archive instead. Tracks use voices 0-2; voice 3 belongs to the effects.
